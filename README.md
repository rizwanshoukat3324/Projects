Welcome to my ###Projects Repository, where I showcase my data analysis and visualization projects using tools like Power BI and Pandas. Each project represents a unique approach to solving real-world data challenges.

1. HR Analysis
This project focuses on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing HR metrics. It includes:

Data modeling using Star and Snowflake schemas.
Visualizations for demographics, employee performance, and attrition trends.
Key insights on satisfaction levels, performance ratings, and hiring trends.
This dashboard helps organizations make data-driven decisions about workforce management and retention strategies.'''

2. Census Insights
A Python and Pandas-based project that processes U.S. Census data for visualizations and analysis. Key highlights include:

Cleaning and transforming data from multiple CSV files into a unified DataFrame.
Scatterplots and histograms for income, gender proportions, and racial demographics.
Techniques to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and split combined columns.
This project simplifies data interpretation for population studies and policy development.
