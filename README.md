# Welcome to My Projects Repository

Welcome to my Projects Repository, where I showcase my data analysis and visualization projects using tools like Power BI Python, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. Each project represents a unique approach to solving real-world data challenges.

## 1. HR Analysis
This project focuses on creating an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing HR metrics. It includes:

- Data modeling using Star and Snowflake schemas.
- Visualizations for demographics, employee performance, and attrition trends.
- Key insights on satisfaction levels, performance ratings, and hiring trends.

This dashboard helps organizations make data-driven decisions about workforce management and retention strategies.

## 2. Census Insights
A Python and Pandas-based project that processes U.S. Census data for visualizations and analysis. Key highlights include:

- Cleaning and transforming data from multiple CSV files into a unified DataFrame.
- Scatterplots and histograms for income, gender proportions, and racial demographics.
- Techniques to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and split combined columns.

This project simplifies data interpretation for population studies and policy development.

## 3. Job Market Analysis
This project involves an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing job market trends, including:

- **Data Preparation**: Cleaned and filtered job postings for key roles (Data Scientist, Analyst, Engineer).
- **Data Modeling**: Created relationships and calculated metrics like salaries and skill demand.
- **Visualizations**: Showcased job trends, salary patterns, and in-demand skills.

The dashboard supports recruitment companies in making data-driven hiring and salary decisions.


## 4. Churn Analysis
This project focuses on creating an interactive Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard in Power BI for a telecom company. It includes:

Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing datasets, including customer demographics, service usage, and contract details, using Power Query. Missing values were handled to ensure accuracy.
Data Modeling: Establishing relationships between tables and optimizing the data model. DAX was used to calculate churn rates, customer lifetime value, and retention KPIs.
Visualizations: Designing an 8-page interactive report featuring customer segmentation, churn trends, and predictive insights with slicers and drill-through capabilities.

This dashboard enables businesses to make data-driven decisions and improve customer retention strategies.

## Stay Tuned
Stay tuned for more projects! Feel free to explore, clone, and provide feedback on my work.

*In the future, I will also share SQL projects and my Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib projects in this repository.*
